# glTF-Generator-Registry

An open registry of tools that create glTF assets.

## Generators

This registry should not be considered an exhaustive list of glTF creation
tools, but rather a highly-structured collection of metadata for a subset of
existing tools. Editors and viewers that load glTF files may use this registry
to help their users report bugs appropriately when glTF files contain errors.
See [REGISTRY.md](dist/REGISTRY.md) for a readonly human-friendly list of tools.
For a machine-readable version, or to contribute, see
[registry.json](registry.json).

## Fields

| field | required | description |
|---|---|---|
| generator | ✅ | Exact `asset.generator` ID string used in glTF assets. Globs (`*`) may be used in place of version strings. |

| bugsURL | | URL for reporting issues. |
